If your data is not going into the database then please check that you have the right Database in your MySQL Server & Table.
If the database and the table is missing then you need to create them which is so simple. Just FOLLOW ME -->

#You need to install Xampp Control Panel v3.2.2 (I use version 3.2.2)

#Go to XAMPP Control Panel and Start  --> 1) Apache
					  2) MySQL
#Go to your browser (open Chrome)
#Type this url -->	http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

Now you are in the main dashboad, just create a database. In your left side, there is an option named "New".

#click on that "New"
#type database name "users1"
#select collation "latin1_swedish_ci"

now create the tables

#type table name "students" n select number of columns "5"
#press on "go" button
#type column name as follows --> "id",	"name",		"username",	"email",	"password"
#select the type as follows -->  "int"	"varchar"	"varchar"	"varchar"	"varchar"
#select the length as follows--> "100"	"100"		"100"		"100"		"100"
#for "id", mark it as Null Index, select as Primary key, Mark on A_I (auto increment)
#now just save it and your first table is ready

Create another table same way
#the database you created named users1, see there is your table named students, before the table there is a option name "New"
#just click on that "New" again
#type table name "reg"
#type column name as follows --> "id",		"name",		"blood",	"email",	"number"	"address"
#select the type as follows -->  "int"		"varchar"	"varchar"	"varchar"	"int"		"varchar"
#select the length as follows--> "100"		"100"		"20"		"100"		"20"		"100"
#for "id", mark it as Null Index, select as Primary key, Mark on A_I (auto increment)
#now just save it and your second table is also ready

now go and run your project
